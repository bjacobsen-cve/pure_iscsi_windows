# pure_iscsi_windows

Update the variables to match your environment. Add your target IQN, target portal IPs and target IPs, and the IP pattern of your iSCSI NICs.

Run as administrator. DO NOT use this script in a mixed environment, as it implements MPIO settings that are strictly best practices for Pure arrays and would not be applicable to other iSCSI storage solutions.
